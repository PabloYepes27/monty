## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables

### [0. push, pall]
* The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.


### [1. pint]
* The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.


### [2. pop]
* The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.


### [3. swap]
* The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.


### [4. add]
* The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.


### [5. nop]
* The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.


### [6. sub]
* The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.


### [7. div]
* The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.


### [8. mul]
* The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.


### [9. mod]
* The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.


### [10. comments]
* When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).


### [11. pchar]
* The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.


### [12. pstr]
* The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.


### [13. rotl]
* The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.


### [14. rotr]
* The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.


### [15. stack, queue]
* Implement the stack and queue opcodes.


### [16. Holberton](1000-holberton.bf)
* Write a Brainf*ck script that prints Holberton, followed by a new line.


### [17. add two diggits](1001-add.bf)
* Add two digits given by the user.


### [18. Multiplication](1002-mul.bf)
* Multiply two digits given by the user.


### [18. Multiplication level up](1003-mul.bf)
* Multiply two digits given by the user.
